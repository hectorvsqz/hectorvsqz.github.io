        <h4>So, if you're looking to create your own page in Github.com, follow these steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a Github account, here you will have the chance to create a user name</li>
            <li>Next, create a repository, give it a name and append .github.io, so for example repo.github.io, or username.github.io</li>
            <li>In the repository, in the code tab, you can create, or drag and drop your website files - Github will search for files with the name index.html, index.md, or README.md, by default as entry files for your website</li>
            <li>You then have to commit the files to your repository</li>
            <li>You can add images, text, videos, links, etc. as you wish</li>
            <li>Navigate to the website to see your results</li>
        </ol>
