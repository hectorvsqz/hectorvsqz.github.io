        <p>So, if you're looking to create your own page in Github.com, follow these steps:</p>
        <p>Create a Github account, here you will have the chance to create a user name</p>
        <p>Next, create a repository, give it a name and append .github.io, so for example repo.github.io, or username.github.io</p>
        <p>
            In the repository, in the code tab, you can create, or drag and drop your website files - Github will search for files with the name index.html, index.md, or README.md, by default
            as entry files for your website
        </p>
        <p>You can add images, text, videos, links, etc. as you wish</p>
        <p>Navigate to the website to see your results</p>
